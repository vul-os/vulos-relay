/**
 * secureTransport.js — @vulos/relay-client credential-transport guard (internal).
 *
 * The relay client is a TRUST-BOUNDARY participant: it holds a short-lived
 * Bearer JWT (the box/app session token) and attaches it to two kinds of
 * outbound request —
 *
 *   • the signaling WebSocket   (signaling.js: Sec-WebSocket-Protocol / ?token=)
 *   • the relay + ICE HTTP calls (fabric.js: Authorization: Bearer …)
 *
 * If the target URL is plaintext (`ws://` / `http://`) to a non-loopback host,
 * that credential travels in the clear — readable by any on-path attacker and
 * captured in proxy / access logs. The endpoint-selection layer already gates
 * its *credentialed health probe* behind an https allowlist (endpoints.js), but
 * the signaling socket and the relay fetches had no equivalent guard: a caller
 * (or a poisoned injected endpoint) supplying `ws://evil.example` would leak the
 * token. This module is the single choke point that decides whether a URL is
 * safe to carry a credential.
 *
 * Policy (fail-closed): a credential may be attached ONLY to
 *   • same-origin / relative URLs         ('' or path-only → inherit page origin)
 *   • `wss://`  or `https://` URLs         (TLS in transit)
 *   • `ws://`   or `http://` to a LOOPBACK host (localhost / 127.0.0.0-8 / ::1)
 *     — the local-dev / self-host-behind-a-TLS-terminator escape hatch.
 * Everything else is rejected so the caller fails closed instead of leaking.
 *
 * Pure JS — no deps, safe to import from any subpath bundle.

//! Inbound gateway — spec §7.2 / §19.7.1 (`smtp-inbound`).
//!
//! Accept a legacy SMTP transaction acting as MX for a domain, reject spam **before DATA**, resolve
//! the recipient's DMTAP key, wrap the RFC 5322 message into an encrypted `kind=0x00 mail` MOTE,
//! **attest** it under the domain-anchored attestation key (§7.2a), deliver into the mesh, and —
//! critically — return SMTP **`250` only after a durable `ack`**, else **`451`** (the §19.7.1
//! silent-loss-avoidance rule: never `250` on mere hand-off). The gateway stores nothing (§7.4):
//! durability lives in the legacy sender's own SMTP retry queue.
//!
//! All network effects are behind traits ([`KeyDirectory`], [`MeshDelivery`], [`AntiAbuse`]) so the
//! whole transaction is driven in-process by tests; a real deployment supplies socket-backed impls.

//! Gateway attestation — spec §7.2a (normative key binding).
//!
//! An inbound legacy message is not end-to-end encrypted before the gateway (the legacy leg is
//! plaintext). To let the recipient trust that a MOTE genuinely arrived through a gateway the
//! recipient's own domain authorized — rather than any operator forging a "legitimate legacy
//! origin" — the gateway signs an **attestation** with a **domain-anchored attestation key**, and
//! the domain publishes that key's public half in DNS:
//!
//! ```text
//! <sel>._dmtap-gw.<domain>.  IN  TXT  "v=dmtapgw1; k=<attestation public key>"
//! ```
//!
//! The recipient node MUST verify the attestation against the key published **under its own
//! domain**, MUST reject one that does not verify, and MUST mark accepted MOTEs as *legacy-origin*
//! (§7.2a). This module provides the signable attestation object, the domain-anchored signing
//! key, an abstract `GwKeyResolver` (the DNS TXT lookup), and the recipient-side verify.

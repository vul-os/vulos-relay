//! Gateway admission, quota, and local-part allocation — spec §7.9, §7.10, §9, §12.2.
//!
//! [`crate::provenance`] defines the *seams* — the [`GatewayAuthz`] policy trait, the
//! [`GatewayMeter`] billing seam, and the [`Bridge`] that ties authz+attestation+metering. This
//! module makes the **operator-facing policy** real on top of those seams, all in OSS (the gateway
//! never prices or bills — it only exposes the meter):
//!
//! - **Authorization modes** ([`AuthzMode`]): an operator runs the gateway either as an
//!   **open-public** relay (anyone may relay — a spam magnet, documented below, **not** the default)
//!   or in **key-registered** mode (the default), where a sender is admitted only after proving
//!   control of a registered DMTAP key by a challenge–response ([`IdentityRegistry::admit`], reusing
//!   `dmtap-core` Ed25519 sign/verify). [`IdentityRegistry`] also implements [`GatewayAuthz`], so it
//!   drops straight into a [`Bridge`] as the per-message policy gate.
//! - **Quota + usage tracking** ([`QuotaLedger`]): a per-registered-identity free allowance plus a
//!   **hard cap**, counted in-crate (messages **and** bytes). When the cap is hit the ledger
//!   **refuses fail-closed** (a normal gateway refusal) and records nothing; on an admitted charge it
//!   emits the usage through the [`GatewayMeter`] seam for the external billing layer to read. The
//!   gateway itself never turns usage into money.
//! - **Vanity local-parts** ([`AliasAllocator`], §7.10): the operator may allocate a chosen
//!   local-part for a registered key, while the **key-derived alias** ([`key_derived_localpart`])
//!   remains the stable default that always resolves — a vanity name is opt-in sugar on top of it,
//!   and collisions are refused fail-closed. The allocator **enforces the normative naming rules**:
//!   a vanity is dot-free (dotted local-parts are reserved for [`crate::forwarded_addr`]), is only
//!   ever meaningful **fully-qualified** as `vanity@<gatewaydomain>` (never a bare, un-anchored
//!   handle — the flat-namespace-consensus problem DMTAP does not solve), may not shadow the
//!   auto-derived namespace ([`RESERVED_ALIAS_PREFIX`] / a key-derived shape) nor an operator
//!   directory identity on the same domain, is **first-come + revocable**, and must pass basic
//!   hygiene. Every failure is a hard, fail-closed reject — the allocator never silently normalizes.
//!
//! Deterministic throughout: challenge freshness takes the clock as an explicit parameter and the
//! nonce is supplied by the caller (production draws it from the OS CSPRNG via [`random_nonce`]), so
//! the whole flow is exercised without a wall clock.
